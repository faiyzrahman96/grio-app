This README file highlights the technologies and methodologies I used in attempting to create the web application for this assignment.

I developed the front-end using React.js in order to create components to render to HTML files using the 
REACTDOM library, as well as a couple different libraries I installed through the use of npm. I implemented 
bootstrap as well in the implementation of my front-end, most notably for FormControl, so that I could manage 
my login form.

My backend technology was created with Flask, which I attempted to connect to my frontend using RESTful APIs 
and HTTP requests. The server would be run through python server.py, and different functions defined in the 
server.py file were to serve for navigation in my web application.

Logging in would often end up resulting in a ERROR 500 Internal Server Error where I'm assuming I redirected to an undefined app route, and due to a lack of time caused by a family emergency, I was unable to implement the counter's formula.
